When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keep your changes local?
I would make my changes remote if I want to share my changes or feel like I need a backup from my repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I might be working on files that have been modified in the remote repository and if the changes are pulled in automatically my changes could be overwritten.

Describe the differences between forks, clones and branches. When would use one instead of another?
A fork is remote copy in Github of an existing repository. A clone is copy of a remote or local repository. A branch is a label for a series of commits. I would use a fork when I want to make change to another person's repository in Github. I would clone when I want to make changes to a remote repository on my local computer. I would branch if I want to make experimental changes or isolate my changes from the master branch of the repository.
